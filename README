Chapter 1. Introduction

Scalable refers to how well a computing system can adapt to changes in load or
available resources.

Distributed refers to how systems are clustered together and interact with each
other.

Systems that are fault tolerant continue to operate predictably when things in
their environment are failing.

By soft real-time, we mean the predictability of response and latency, handling
a constant throughput, and guaranteeing a response within an acceptable time
frame.

High availability minimizes or completely eliminates downtime as a result of
bugs, outages, upgrades, or other operational activities.

OTP is a domain-independent set of frameworks, principles, and patterns that
guide and support the structure, design, implementation, and deployment of
Erlang systems.
